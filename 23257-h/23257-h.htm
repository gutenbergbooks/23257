<h3><span class="smcap">Scene 1</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>An old park with avenues of trees leading
away in all directions. Directly in
background of stage there is a sheet of
water fringed by willow and poplar trees.
On the right and left is a high box hedge
formed in curves with the top clipped in
grotesque shapes mostly of birds. A statue
is placed in the centre of each hedge, and
beneath the statues are seats.</i></p>

<p><i>When the curtain rises several courtiers
are discovered wandering or sitting about.
There is much laughing and whispering
behind fans.</i>]</p></div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">2d Courtier</span></p>

<p>What an extraordinary evening! How
calm the water is! It makes the swans look
exactly like topaz clouds reflecting in a titanic
mirror.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">A Lady</span></p>

<p>Yes. The sky is just as clear as the Queen's
ear-rings of aquamarine. A storm could
hardly blow up out of such blueness, so the
masque is bound to be heavenly.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">3d Courtier</span> [<i>approaching</i>]</p>

<p>I hate to interrupt your celestial jargon
with human speech, but does anybody know
whether Phedro has been able to find the
Prince and give him the Queen's command?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Lady</span> [<i>answering with frigid distinction</i>]</p>

<p>Probably not, but the Prince can never be
found and is always forgiven. It is much to
be loved in secret by a&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">1st Courtier</span> [<i>laying finger on his lips</i>]</p>

<p>Hush!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">2d Courtier</span> [<i>reprovingly</i>]</p>

<p>At court one must try not to think aloud
or one is perhaps overheard by&mdash;[<i>makes the
motion of a blade across his throat</i>].</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">2d Lady</span></p>

<p>O nonsense! Why, Phedro confides in
everybody, and so nobody ever believes him.
Yet he is always quite right.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">2d Courtier</span></p>

<p>He puts his nose into the dust that is swept
out of great corners. Indeed he looks in unthinkable
places, and finds the incredible.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">1st Courtier</span></p>

<p>Do you know what he told me lately?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Lady</span></p>

<p>I am ailing with curiosity.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">1st Courtier</span></p>

<p>It was a fantastic tale about one of our own
lot. Indeed about one wearing strawberry
leaves and with two very young sons growing
up, and she, apparently imagining the younger
to be the living likeness, growing plainer
every day, of a former indiscretion, gives directions
to her favourite lackey to get rid of
this wrong one and he, from spleen, gives the
honest child away. The lady dies shortly
after; the father never suspects anything.
The bastard inherits, so the entire tragedy
was in vain.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">3d Courtier</span></p>

<p>Fear is always absurd. You should be
quite sure you are found out first; even then
you have only to look rather sharply at anyone<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
you fear in order to reduce <i>Him</i>. Indeed,
the best of defences is presumption upon the
brotherhood of sin.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">A Lady</span></p>

<p>O how true!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Phedro</span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>A person of shifty, wizened visage enters.
In a jocular tone.</i>]</p></div>

<p>What is "O how true?" [<i>He glances about
him.</i>] You are all looking very <i>en rapport</i>
with the Almighty. In fact as if He had been
telling you secrets. Did they concern me?
I am always a prey to the desire of hearing
what is said&mdash;just before and just after I am
in a room.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">1st Courtier</span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>With much pomposity hiding his embarrassment.</i>]</p></div>

<p>We were commanded to be in attendance
on the Queen. Could you find Prince
Charles? You were sent to find him, were
you not?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Phedro</span> [<i>nodding to the right</i>]</p>

<p>I have achieved my significant purpose.
The Prince is playing at croquet with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
Duchess, and says when the Queen arrives
to let him know.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">1st Courtier</span></p>

<p>He is very casual. How very indiscreet of
him!&mdash;to show so plainly his passion for the
Duchess.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Phedro</span></p>

<p>Oh no! Mountains cannot knock one another
down. They can only be blown up,
from underneath [<i>smiles enigmatically</i>].</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">1st Courtier</span></p>

<p>You are difficult to follow.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Phedro</span></p>

<p>My lord, I am speaking in metaphor. It
is a dodge I learned from the poets.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">3d Courtier</span></p>

<p>I repeat, you are difficult and poetry is
impossible to follow. However, poetry is no
longer the fashion.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Takes a pinch of snuff, and looks with
agreeable enmity at <span class="smcap">2d Courtier</span>.</i>]</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Phedro</span> [<i>deprecatingly</i>]</p>

<p>I merely try to match my words against
your silks and laces, my lord. But&mdash;her
Majesty is approaching.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Enter the <span class="smcap">Queen</span>, a sharp-featured,
neurotic-looking woman. One of her Cabinet
is speaking earnestly to her and she
is paying him scant attention.</i>]</p></div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Minister</span></p>

<p>It is vitally necessary that we should discover
upon what terms they would capitulate.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Queen</span></p>

<p>Yes, and they must be heavily taxed for
holding out so long. Imagine other people
presuming to be patriotic. It simply draws
everything out to such an absurd length.
Ah, how irritable it makes me to think.
Phedro, where is the Prince, where is Prince
Charles?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>During the last of her speech she withdraws
her arm from the Minister's, who,
seeing there is no further hope of holding
her attention, withdraws respectfully and
quite unobserved.</i>]</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Phedro</span></p>

<p>Attending impatiently the arrival of your
Majesty upon the other side of the copse.
I go to make him aware of your presence.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>He bows himself out, and the <span class="smcap">Queen</span>
looking anxiously in the direction of the
vanishing <span class="smcap">Phedro</span> espies <span class="smcap">Prince
Charles</span> and the <span class="smcap">Duchess</span> upon a lawn.</i>]</p></div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Queen</span> [<i>adjusting her lorgnette</i>]</p>

<p>How silly people look playing croquet.
The Duchess appears to me exactly like a
bent hairpin.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">2d Courtier</span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Looking also in the direction of the
<span class="smcap">Duchess</span> and half admiringly.</i>]</p></div>

<p>Indeed, Madame, her Grace is too tall to
look well bending down.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Queen</span> [<i>turning upon him</i>]</p>

<p>I hope you are not hiding a mud-sling in
your silk swallow-tail. Perhaps you forget a
courtier's principal duty should be the culture
of tact, and tact is nothing whatever
but helping me exaggerate my humours until
I tire of them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">2d Courtier</span></p>

<p>Indeed, indeed, Madame, your Majesty's
brilliance blinds my eyes with humility.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Prince Charles</span>, a slender, exotic-looking
gentleman.</i>]</p></div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Prince</span></p>

<p>Dear Cousin, how delicious you are looking&mdash;so
royal and alert. [<i>He bends over her
hand.</i>] Ah! [<i>His vitality seems suddenly to
leave him at the thought.</i>] I have just been
trying to lessen Josephine's habitual <i>ennui</i>
by making her my victim at croquet.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Queen</span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>With a slight lounge into sentimentality.</i>]</p></div>

<p>I am sure she, like many others, is easily
your victim&mdash;at croquet. But come, let us
be alone, let us dismiss this chain of faces,
they confine my thoughts. I would like to
talk well, I would like to talk fantastically,
that is, I wish you would think of something
original for tonight's entertainment.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>She signals to the courtiers that they
may leave.</i>]</p></div>

<p>After all it is the prelude to your nuptials.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
Let us think of something to surprise Josephine.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Prince</span></p>

<p>To <i>surprise</i> Josephine! But nothing could
surprise Josephine.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Queen</span></p>

<p>You are probably mistaken. I believe any
reality would surprise her. All her life she
has watched life passing in a mirror. She has
never touched a thing&mdash;I think she has very
curious hands. But let us&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>She perceives that some of the courtiers
are still lingering about. Turns to them.</i>]</p></div>

<p>I have several times intimated that you may
disperse.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Courtiers go out swiftly.</i>]</p></div>

<p>[<i>Looking at Prince wistfully.</i>] You can imagine
that I am a little sad today. There is
a mist between me and everything else, the
gardens are dull, the flowers have lost their
fragrance. A sirocco seems blowing up from
the graves of all young people who have
never been given a chance. Tell me, do you
care much for Josephine?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Charles</span> [<i>pompously</i>]</p>

<p>My Cousin, my Sovereign, this marriage
has been arranged, I presume in lieu of my
lost brother, the Prince of Vaucluse, and
apparently in order further to quilt your
Majesty's exchequer.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Queen</span> [<i>interrupting him</i>]</p>

<p>Your poor brother; your poor brother; if
it had been he, how much heartbreak I would
have been spared.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Prince</span></p>

<p>Which means, your Majesty?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Queen</span></p>

<p>That I have been talking to myself, and
you have been listening, which is ungallant,
as if you were to let me put rouge on my nose
instead of on my cheeks without stopping me.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Prince</span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Rather uneasily returning to a favourite subject.</i>]</p></div>

<p>Well, your Majesty, now I have accustomed
myself so long to the idea of my
marriage that it gives me pleasure and calm
to dwell on it, especially when I gaze upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
Josephine's tapering regality&mdash;then I am
most inclined to think your esteemed father,
our former King, was wise in recommending
it, and that Fate was not too unkind in disposing
of my half-brother in her own mysterious way.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>He smiles rather unpleasantly.</i>]</p></div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Queen</span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Who has not attended the last part of his speech.</i>]</p></div>

<p>Yes. To provide at one clip for her&mdash;the
child of his love, and for me, the result of
his duty, proved him a parent, a statesman,
and, tonight, I am a little inclined to think, a
blackguard. However, you know this marriage
has none of my command in it and there
are many ways out.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i><span class="smcap">Phedro</span> invisible to the <span class="smcap">Queen</span> and
the <span class="smcap">Prince</span> slides into the shadow of a
giant oak tree.</i>]</p></div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Prince</span></p>

<p>You mean if either of us&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Queen</span></p>

<p>That if any charge of unworthiness could
be brought by either of you against the other,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
then it would be my duty even at the last hour&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Prince</span> [<i>suddenly</i>]</p>

<p>Well, unfortunately, my various dissipations
have only rendered me romantic in the
eyes of your court, and as for Josephine&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Queen</span></p>

<p>Ah, her appearance gives no clue to her
mind [<i>with an attempted lightness</i>], save occasionally
there is too much scent on her
cambric.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Prince</span></p>

<p>Why do you dislike Josephine?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Queen</span></p>

<p>I do not dislike her, but she behaves unbecomingly.
She is very arrogant. Arrogance
does not become a bastard.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Prince</span> [<i>in a teasing vein</i>]</p>

<p>You do dislike her. You hate her, even
though she is your half-sister, but I find her
enchanting. I adore her cold, slender finger
tips and the perfection of her contemptuous
profile. She moves exactly like a swan.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Queen</span> [<i>trying to control her emotion</i>]</p>

<p>At last you are giving yourself entirely
away. I am hearing what I know. Ugh!
how doubly unpleasant!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Prince</span></p>

<p>Why should I not give myself away to you, Cousin?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Queen</span></p>

<p>You mean I am powerless to harm either of you.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Prince</span></p>

<p>Why should you wish to harm us?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Queen</span></p>

<p>There are many things you might not
understand; for instance, there is a love that
is half hatred. It is sprinkled into life in a
rather strange manner&mdash;by wounds. However,
I am becoming sentimental and I hate
sentimentality. It reminds me of people with
colds in their heads who have lost their pocket
handkerchiefs.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Prince</span> [<i>in evident uneasiness</i>]</p>

<p>Madame, your eloquence is remarkable,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
but to say that you are mysterious is all that I dare to say.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Queen</span></p>

<p>You dare to say what you want to say
[<i>bitterly</i>]. You have courage enough to satisfy
your curiosities like everybody else, but I
have always noticed that when people are
not curious their manners become extraordinary.
However, we are forgetting about
the f&ecirc;te. Let us call Phedro.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Prince</span> [<i>bowing</i>]</p>

<p>With pleasure.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>He calls. <span class="smcap">Phedro</span> emerges after a few
seconds at an entirely different angle from
the place where he was concealed.</i>]</p></div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Phedro</span></p>

<p>Majesty.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Queen</span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Addressing him in a peremptory voice.</i>]</p></div>

<p>It is my wish that you should think of
something bizarre to be included in the festivities
of tonight. The Prince and myself
do not seem able to put our minds on it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Phedro</span></p>

<p>I think most certainly, Majesty, there
should be something bizarre about these
festivities, but Majesty&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>He makes her a low bow.</i>]</p></div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Queen</span> [<i>interrogatively</i>]</p>

<p>Yes?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Phedro</span> [<i>sliding up to her</i>]</p>

<p>Could I beg a moment alone with your
Majesty? For it would be my humble view
that both <i>fianc&eacute;s</i> share the surprise.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Queen</span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Turning to the <span class="smcap">Prince</span> with a gesture of dismissal.</i>]</p></div>

<p>Go along, Charles. At any rate you have
a sort of sleight-of-hand manner of looking
at your watch that makes me rather nervous.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Prince</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Phedro</span></p>

<p>Pleasure has two extremes, Madame. One

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Queen</span> [<i>pacing up and down</i>]</p>

<p>I must have one or the other. What can
be done. Think for me, advise me. I am

wants a thing very much, everything blurs.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Phedro</span></p>

<p>Majesty, some mountebanks arrived at the

before your Majesty.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Queen</span> [<i>coming out of a reverie</i>]</p>

<p>Are they dancers, or do they act plays?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Phedro</span></p>

<p>Their performance I understand is peculiar.
One of them is blind, the other is deformed in

one who heals the scars of flesh or heart

<p>They do not sound original.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Phedro</span></p>

<p>And yet from the effect they stir there
must be something. It appears the clown

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Queen</span></p>

<p>It would be charming to laugh, to be unable

Gwymplane has been to me! I wish I had

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Dea</span></p>

<p>Gwymplane worships you. While you are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
singing and smiling I do not think anything
could make him unhappy.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Dea</span></p>

<p>I hope not. You know I feel that he has
given his soul into my hands and that I must
take care of it as I would a little child. Yes,
I feel as if Gwymplane were my child, and
yet something more than my child that

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Phedro</span></p>

<p>Yes. They had an amusing way of putting
young children into a press&mdash;young children
whose existence it would have been very
uncomfortable to admit in certain glittering
circles. This press was shaped like a bottle
so that the growth became abnormal, and
when the press was lifted the human form
had already attained the shape of a bottle.
They could also print everlastingly rather
strange expressions upon the human countenance.</p>

move the cart to left centre of stage; with a
click the sides of the carriage are flung
open and a stage about twelve feet wide and
four feet above the ground appears. In the
back is a green curtain, ornamented with
constellations. Suddenly a grotesque figure
completely hooded and masked, attended
by two small drummer boys, makes its
appearance. The figure squats upon the
floor in direct centre of stage. The drummers
seat themselves beside it and all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>

their drums, the centre figure upon a flute.
No human part of him can be seen, save
his hands which are remarkably beautiful,
sensitive and pallid. He moves them with
extraordinary grace. He plays upon his
flute an air from India. Suddenly upon
the stage above him appears a Hindu girl.
She executes a sinuous pantomimic dance
of youth and desire. The figure playing
upon the flute gradually turns his back
to the audience and facing the dancer continues
to play. Finally the dancer, noticing
her admirer, commences to dance for
him alone. The music becomes more
breathless; the hooded figure plays a
screaming tone upon his flute. Immediately
a third slave, attired as a drummer,
rushes out and catches his flute from the
green masque, who jumps upon the stage,
and seizing the dancer, savagely&mdash;gracefully,
about her slim waist, dances with
her, at once tenderly and primitively.</i>]</p></div>

heard. The drummers play a strange,
sinister march. An old man enters&mdash;the
slave owner. He sees his slave in the arms
of one whom she obviously loves, and
rushes at the masked figure with his sword.

his coat and stands revealed before the

with amazement and he lets out a terrible
yell of laughter. The slave girl who has
stood watching him, now creeps round to
see what is causing him so much mirth,
and gazing up suddenly into the face of
her partner utters a shriek of horror and
runs from the stage. The slave owner

one single instant their glances seem to
pass through one another&mdash;the exquisite

his lips with an expression of intense
amusement. Suddenly from behind <span class="smcap">Gwymplane</span>
steps <span class="smcap">Dea</span>, and he returns with
an almost imperceptible start to his act.
Seeing this lovely apparition, he throws
himself at her feet, and she, apparently

puts her slim hands in his wild hair, and
they go through some tender motions to an
exquisite melody upon the flute. Gradually
with gestures of pity and love she
invites him to go with her, and he hardly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
believing is about to be led away, when

of utter horror. <span class="smcap">Dea</span> attempts drawing
<span class="smcap">Gwymplane</span> away, but he resists,
becoming again a victim to the old charm.
The slave girl, with a wild gesture, offers
herself to him. Simultaneously, <span class="smcap">Dea</span> motions
him with prayer to go with her. He
makes some pitiful indecisive motions between
them. <span class="smcap">Dea</span> wrings her hands; the
slave girl smiles; when, with a sudden
gesture of despair, <span class="smcap">Gwymplane</span> takes out
his knife and makes a motion of cutting
out his heart, then sinks upon the ground,
and suddenly holds up his heart dripping
with blood in his two pale hands. The

to <span class="smcap">Dea</span>, who presses it against her own.
<span class="smcap">Gwymplane</span> breathes his last, and the slave,

Gwymplane is fully entitled to all the immediate

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Dea</span></p>

within them amber lights. In the
centre of the room falls a crystal candelabra
with five small slender scarlet candles. On
stage right a slender bed made entirely of
the body of a swan&mdash;a canopy over it of
pale rose net is attached with three blue
feathers to the ceiling. This canopy drops
over the head and foot of the bed. On
stage left is a dressing mirror and table
draped in fresh white muslin and rare
lace. Below this table is a door&mdash;another
door is directly opposite and behind the
bed which faces the audience. In direct
centre is a tall oblong window draped with
a daffodil yellow taffeta faintly striped in
mauve. A little in front, beneath this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>

pillows of exquisite brocade. The chairs
and other appointments of furniture are
cream-colored, bespattered with flowers and
reminiscent of Venice. On the right, just

features on a black onyx pedestal. The

<p>I shall not talk.</p>

<p>But in that spiritual condition which follows<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>

probably be seeking, straining, to express
your mind and the direction will probably be
to avenge your blind girl.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Gwymplane</span></p>

you must share the discomfort of my own ignorance.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Duchess</span> [<i>in a more kindly tone</i>]</p>

<p>Listen to me, clown. You were brought to
me tonight to relieve me of a whim, I admit
that. And you brought me no relief.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Gwymplane</span> [<i>with sophistication</i>]</p>

Madame. But, considering you waived my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
personal defects [<i>he winces</i>], just why did I not&mdash;please you?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Duchess</span></p>

<p>But I told you before&mdash;I wanted a clown,
and you talk like the very essence of all these
lords and poets. But that is aside&mdash;I am to be married tomorrow.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Gwymplane</span></p>

<p>I know,&mdash;to him&mdash;and you wish him spared
the public lash of scandal, I suppose.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Duchess</span></p>

<p>He need not be spared it entirely&mdash;I do
not ask that. You can make plea to the
Queen, if you wish, the day after the ceremony&mdash;only
not tomorrow. Much rests on that for me.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Gwymplane</span></p>

<p>Madame, with the insolence of your class,
you are asking favours of one whose degradation
you have sought and shared.</p>

<p>Perhaps, but you must remember that I

<p>Life, life. It has suddenly burst its leash&mdash;torn

us, mortally, I think, [<i>glances at <span class="smcap">Dea</span></i>] O,
the pain, the tragedy that can come out of
nonsense. Will Dea live, can Dea live?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Ursus</span> [<i>sighing heavily</i>]</p>

<p>Perhaps, perhaps. How quiet and smiling
she looks. There is some great pathos about
her peacefulness as if Heaven were restoring
to her something cruelly lost in this world.</p>

<p>Oh, my soul was not in all that.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Ursus</span></p>

<p>Most people perish from thinking like you.
[<i>earnestly</i>] Somewhere in you is a blinding,
transfigured face, struggling up out of the
sprawled, coiling limbs of infinite pasts, yet
put it in certain conditions and it retains its

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Gwymplane</span></p>

<p>Hope is for people who have not such keen
noses as I. I can smell the decay in myself
far too well to go near the person I love with
it. Only to sleep, to sleep, and not have to
make my way any more, through these biting,
malicious, stifling memories. How can a

morasses the body can clamp him into!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">1st Lady</span></p>

<p>What could you have possibly expected?
I suppose the marriage is off. Josephine
could never be interested in anything, and as for the Prince&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">2d Lady</span></p>

<p>His self-interest would push anything else out of him.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">1st Lady</span></p>

<p>Of course, if it <i>is</i> off, Josephine must have
made him appear unbecoming and <i>she</i> probably<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
brought all the candles in the palace to
help illuminate Josephine's mistake. Phew!
they are all quite dreadful.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">1st Courtier</span></p>

<p>Sh! It is unwise to be so indiscreet, even
in a crisis. Remember, we have to face each
other, and all of these others every day for
years. Perhaps the memory of your candour
will make you feel a little ridiculous later.</p>

<p>No, Majesty.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Queen</span></p>

<p>Have me informed immediately upon her

your absorbing trifles in a lower tone. My<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>

<p>She is illusive. She is like a succession of

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">3d Courtier</span></p>

<p>I don't wish to seem unpleasant, but I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
wonder if you could talk a little less or say something.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">2d Courtier</span> [<i>regarding him witheringly</i>]</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">1st Lady</span></p>

<p>Wasn't the Duchess radiant last night?

<p>It is an outrage! People who are lazy
enough to be found out are a menace to all of us.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">3d Courtier</span></p>

<p>A gentleman will hardly know where he is
safe when the Duchess of Beaumont can
allow such an occurrence.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Phedro</span></p>

<p>I am afraid I must make my exit from this

how a man looks who has slept well among

<p>I am tasting my own cooking. It is delicious.
However, enough public reverie.
When the Duchess comes, announce her to

<p>O, what is the sense of trying to carry a

lately to hold on to my <i>savoir faire</i>.
Here are my explosions in a nutshell. The
announcement that the clown Gwymplane

authentic. He is in consequence your <i>fianc&eacute;</i>.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Duchess</span> [<i>losing her wits in a temper</i>]</p>

<p>You must be mad to suppose I should

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>The <span class="smcap">Duchess</span> is about to break out.</i>]</p></div>

<p>Please don't be banal. I couldn't bear to

<p>Charles, my dear, don't let us be absurd.

<p>You are neat in phrases, Josephine, but

<p>My dear Josephine, I could not bear to
have you hold me responsible for these grotesque
discoveries of last night. Apparently
he is my brother, and it should have been me
who suffered those terrible deformities save
for the mischievous meddling of a malicious
servant; but certainly now you are his lawful
bride, and I have no other name than one
the Queen's mercy can devise.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Josephine</span></p>

<p>Save for&mdash;but it is so very early and bright, and we are not alone.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Duchess</span></p>

<p>So sorry to be in the way. I shall hope to
be dismissed presently. I can hear you are
tuning up, Charles. Ah, well, I shall have a
clown for a husband. What more should a
married woman wish for? And plenty of
time to catch the roses and the sighs wafting
up from my gardens. But Charles, where is
your little blind girl?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Prince</span></p>

<p>How should I know? She found the Queen and delivered her note.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Queen</span></p>

<p>How did you know she had a note to deliver?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Prince</span></p>

<p>I ran into her with Phedro coming through
the garden. He went to see if all was right
with Josephine, while I&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Duchess</span></p>

<p>Mingled hands, at least, for she said: "He
told me that he wanted me for himself and
forever, nor was he the Court Steward, for
he wore a great oblong stone upon his hand."
I hope she comes back with my intended, and
tells to your Majesty the story of Charles's
little lapse into the romantic. O, listening to
her one must believe her, for she has all that
obvious lack of fancy only to be found among
rarely good people. Her face is quite open
and classic, unbroken by the slightest hint of
imagination. A lie couldn't possibly twist up
through such regular lines.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Queen</span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Over her face has gradually grown a singular change.</i>]</p></div>

<p>Mingling hands, ah, that was why&mdash;[<i>she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
bites her lip, passing her hand across her brow.</i>]
However, to that later. Josephine&mdash;[<i>in a

with our disposition. Go now and prepare
to become the Duchess of Vaucluse.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i><span class="smcap">Josephine</span> is about to exit, when <span class="smcap">Phedro</span> enters hurriedly.</i>]</p></div>

<p>Your Majesty.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Queen</span></p>

<p>Oh, what an air of rush there is about everything
this morning. Well, speak, speak.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Phedro</span></p>

<p>Her Grace cannot become the Duchess of Vaucluse.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Queen</span></p>

<p>Ah, why not?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Phedro</span></p>

<p>He is beyond us.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Queen</span></p>

<p>Do you mean that he has sought for himself,
the only satisfactory rest!&mdash;a sleep without
dreams. He is dead!&mdash;How?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Phedro</span></p>

<p>The philosopher and the blind girl escaped
with him at dawn; long before sunrise an old,
disused hulk was seen going down the river,
and in the blaze of this morning has returned
with only the philosopher and his hired oarsmen.
Apparently the blind girl died from the
tremors of escape, and the clown in his grief
found nothing left in himself to face life with,
so he threw his distressed person into the sea.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Queen</span></p>

<p>So, Josephine, your second bridegroom has
been seduced away from you by Destiny.
Charles, your fortune, which was at any rate
confiscate to your brother, now passes to the
Crown. I wonder just how you will manage.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i><span class="smcap">Charles</span> throws her a tender, confident

<p>But one thing at a time. Josephine, what
occurs to you in this fitful moment?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Duchess</span></p>

<p>Life nauseates me so at the moment that
it is difficult to imagine any corner where I
would not be too dizzy with hatred to stand.
If you will permit me, I shall return to my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
rooms to think. There are some agreeable
things scattered through my rooms that may
possibly inspire direction.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Queen</span></p>

<p>Your sensations, Josephine, they have always
been so much more acute than your
emotions. I wonder if you could not turn
with a certain surprising equanimity from
regarding the marble forms of your Greeks
to the Gothic saints of wood and ivory, then
one would detect incense in the fold of your
shroud instead of patchouli in the pleats of
your cambric. You know, probably you
could find in the distortions of religious mania
a perfect <i>pendant</i> to your taste for deformities in life.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Duchess</span></p>

<p>You are cruel, and you are irreverent.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Queen</span></p>

<p>Ah, my dear, in that last epithet speaks
your extreme desirability for the vocation,
superstition, which is nothing more nor less
than fear of reason, or possibly a certain
instinct that the truth would make everything
look rather second class&mdash;if one is second class one's self.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Duchess</span></p>

<p>I suppose it is not incumbent upon me to
stand here in order that my character inspire
you with further Socratic comment.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Queen</span></p>

<p>Not at all, my dear sister; by all means
seek your fauns and draperies and forgive me
for prattling on quite regardless of sowing the
tragic seed&mdash;<i>ennui</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>At this juncture it is only the intense

<p>Well, adieu, Charles, I suppose you will
go on alternating between vice and sentimentality
until the curtain drops. You
know, one reason why you never attracted me?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Prince</span></p>

<p>Josephine, is this quite in taste?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Duchess</span></p>

<p>Taste is something one uses on arranging
one's rooms, not upon human beings.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Queen</span></p>

<p>Well hit, Josephine. You have at least the
satisfaction of going out to the ringing of the bull's eye.</p>

<p>Possibly.</p>

verbosity to take the place of feeling. It is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
so exactly what you would say to the brewer's
daughter, had you selected her to save your estate and pay your bills.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Prince</span></p>

<p>Ah, Anne, Anne, why will you be so ironic?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Queen</span></p>

<p>Once or twice I thought of not being ironic,
of looking into some person's eyes, and not
finding that I had to look away, of resting
with someone in a long silence full of exchanged beauties.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Prince</span> [<i>approaching her</i>]</p>

<p>Anne, dear, how&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>The <span class="smcap">Queen</span> laughs and backs away

<p>Stand that way another instant, Charles.
Ah, here is everything I have wanted,
schemed for, wept about, in the position I
have dreamt of it. [<i>She glances out at the
park.</i>] The back drop is perfect also. Birds'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
song, the freshness of morning, sunlight,
youth,&mdash;youth to be gotten through somehow.
However, here it all is, a dream&mdash;and
not turning pale as all the others did in daylight.
Yet, strangely enough, I cannot find
a self in me to come forward and take these
things as they are now.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Prince</span></p>

<p>Anne, Anne, for God's sake&mdash;I swear to you I can explain everything.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Queen</span></p>

<p>Try not to let your fear of personal consequences
intercept the pity you should feel for me.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Prince</span></p>

<p>Anne, I love you, I love you.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Queen</span></p>

<p>Why, why is it that people cannot watch
anything die in silence? I suppose after all
you are not sufficiently ruthless to carry
off your own selfishness with any sort of dignity.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Prince</span> [<i>sulkily</i>]</p>

<p>You do not believe me. You credit the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
report of a woman who has every reason to hate me.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Queen</span></p>

<p>No, I credit intuition, instinct that is always
stinging past what one wants to think
and flinging some dismantled idol across one's
feet. Somehow, from looking down at a lie
one can never look up to that particular thing again.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Prince</span></p>

<p>It was the lie you minded more than what I did.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Queen</span></p>

<p>I think a truth, no matter of what kind,
would have given me some point of exhilaration
upon which to try you out.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Prince</span></p>

<p>Oh, Anne, I do not understand you.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Queen</span></p>

<p>It is as well we found out. How jocosely
casual we are about our spirits. We tie them
into some bondage of eternity for the security
of a night's lodging, and then wonder that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
life grows sour upon our palate. [<i>she smiles
over at <span class="smcap">Charles's</span> bewilderment</i>] Which
means, in the literal terms of those who credit
reincarnation, that if we married, those
things you would have to do to keep your
heart up would cause your next showing to
degenerate into a slight motion of slime at
the base of mountains. Think of the distance
lost, Charles, for such a little mincing forward
step. Come, the morning wanes. Fortunately
there are things to do, no matter what
cannot be done. I shall return you half of
your fortune, which, you will remember, is
wholly confiscate to the Crown, but upon the
condition that you pass the fleeting future
from well under my nose. I could not bear
to be incessantly reading my past, which is
printed all over you in large letters. Really,
Charles, you are a shifting mass of monuments
to the hope of a ridiculous person.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Prince</span></p>

<p>You have broken my heart. I may as well go, I suppose.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Queen</span></p>

<p>Thank God, I have a literal mind, for what
you have said, as you have said it, literally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
means, "I see you have found me out, so I
suppose there is no use wasting any more time around here."</p>
